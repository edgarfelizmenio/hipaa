# HIPAA Compliance Checker
The HIPAA Compliance Checker is a formal translation of HIPAA into Prolog. The Prolog translation can be executed and reports whether a given action complies with HIPAA. The demonstration version of the site is available at http://www.tcs-trddc.com/privacy/HIPAA/.

## Coverage
The current implementation checks compliance with HIPAA rules 160.502 and 164.506 of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification, Regulation Text: 45 CFR Parts 160, 162, and 164 (Unofficial Version, as amended through February 16, 2006) PDF 769KB

We translate the HIPAA regulation into Prolog one statement at a time. You can verify our translation by examining the side-by-side comparison. If you find any errors, please file an issue using our issue tracker.
